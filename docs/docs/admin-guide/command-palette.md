# Command Palette

The command palette is a keyboard-driven quick-navigation feature that lets you jump to any page, run actions, or search across the admin dashboard without using the mouse.

## Opening the Command Palette

Press **Cmd+K** (macOS) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) from anywhere in the admin dashboard. You can also click the search icon in the top bar.

A modal overlay appears with a search input field.

## Using the Command Palette

1. **Start typing** -- enter a keyword or page name (e.g., "blogs", "settings", "media").
2. **Browse results** -- matching pages and actions appear instantly as you type.
3. **Navigate with keyboard** -- use the arrow keys (Up/Down) to move through results.
4. **Select** -- press **Enter** to navigate to the highlighted result.
5. **Dismiss** -- press **Escape** or click outside the palette to close it.

## What You Can Search For

The command palette indexes:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Pages** | Dashboard, Blogs, Pages, Media, Navigation, Settings, API Keys, etc. |
| **Actions** | New blog post, Upload media, Add member. |
| **Sites** | Switch between your sites by typing the site name. |

### Page Navigation

Type any page name to navigate directly to it. For example:

- Type `blog` to see "Blogs" and "New Blog Post".
- Type `nav` to see "Navigation".
- Type `set` to see "Settings".

### Quick Actions

Some results are actions rather than pages. Selecting them triggers the action directly (e.g., "New blog post" opens the blog editor with a blank form).

## Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` | Open the command palette |
| `Arrow Up` / `Arrow Down` | Navigate through results |
| `Enter` | Select the highlighted result |
| `Escape` | Close the palette |

## Tips

- The command palette remembers your most recent searches and prioritizes frequently used pages.
- You do not need to type the full page name -- partial matches work (e.g., "med" matches "Media").
- The palette is available on every page of the admin dashboard.
- It is the fastest way to navigate the dashboard once you learn the page names.
