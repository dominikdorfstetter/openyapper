# Dashboard

The home dashboard is the first page you see after signing in. It provides an at-a-glance overview of your site's content and activity, along with a setup checklist for new sites.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Click **Dashboard** in the sidebar or navigate to `/dashboard`. The dashboard always reflects data for the currently selected site in the site selector.

## Setup Checklist

When you create a new site, the dashboard displays a setup checklist to help you get started. The checklist tracks essential setup steps:

- **Create your first blog post** -- guides you to the blog editor.
- **Add a page** -- prompts you to create a static page.
- **Upload media** -- directs you to the media library to upload your first image.
- **Configure navigation** -- links to the navigation menu builder.
- **Add locales** -- reminds you to add supported languages for your content.
- **Set up social links** -- links to the social links configuration.

Each item shows a checkmark once completed. The checklist disappears once all steps are done, or you can dismiss it manually.

## Statistics Cards

The dashboard displays summary statistics for the selected site:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Blog posts** | Total number of blog posts, with counts for published, draft, and scheduled. |
| **Pages** | Total number of pages and their publication status. |
| **Media files** | Total number of uploaded media assets. |
| **Documents** | Total document count. |

Each card is clickable and navigates to the corresponding listing page.

## Recent Activity

The recent activity section shows the latest actions performed on the site:

- Content created, updated, or deleted.
- Media uploads.
- Settings changes.
- Member additions or removals.

Each entry shows the action type, the affected resource, the user who performed it, and a relative timestamp (e.g., "2 hours ago"). Click any entry to navigate to the affected resource.

## Quick Actions

The dashboard may include quick-action buttons for common tasks:

- **New blog post** -- opens the blog editor with a blank post.
- **Upload media** -- opens the media upload dialog.
- **View site** -- opens your site's public URL in a new tab.

## My Drafts

If you have unpublished drafts, the dashboard highlights them so you can quickly resume editing. Click any draft to open it in the editor.

## Next Steps

- [Sites](./sites) -- manage your sites.
- [Blogs](./content/blogs) -- create and publish blog content.
- [Media](./media) -- upload and manage media files.
